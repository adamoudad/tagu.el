#+TITLE: Tagu.el is a simple program for managing the status of multiple projects
* Intro
Let's consider you have one directory in which you store all your projects as a collection of sub-directory. Each project can have multiple tags such as =production=, =stale=, =test=, etc, which marks its development status or any other information. This list of tags is written in a file named =tags= at the root of the project folder.

/Tagu.el/ lets you manage (add or delete) these tags, list projects with their associated tags, or list tags with their associated projects.

* Why
I am doing this mainly to improve my skills in Emacs LISP. Any contribution or feedback is welcome! I would not be surprised to find out an Emacs package already does this a lot better than /Tagu.el/, although I am not aware of any yet.
